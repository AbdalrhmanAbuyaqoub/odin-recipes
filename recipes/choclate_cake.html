    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's nothing like a good ol' back-of-the-box recipe. This recipe for Hershey's chocolate cake can be found on the baking aisle of any grocery store (specifically, on the label of the brand's signature unsweetened cocoa powder).  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetend coca powder</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>i teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. </li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand. </li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely. </li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency. </li>

    </ol>
